    abstract: Unexpected monetary tightening predicts a contraction in aggregate corporate bonds but an expansion in bank loans. Using micro-data, I argue that, large, high rated firms with high collateral value rebalance towards bank loans and away from corporate bonds as the relative spread of bond over loan increases. This drives the aggregate evidence. I explain these facts in a heterogeneous agents New Keynesian model by making bank loans safer (collateralized) than defaultable bonds but issued at a greater intermediation cost. An interest rate hike raises default risk and hence the cost of bond financing. Substitution takes place within large, unconstrained firms, while constrained firms tend to issue more equity. My results imply that bank credit is ``misallocated" from constrained productive to unconstrained firms. Additionally, this substitution effect mitigates the negative impact on large firm investment but not enough to avoid a decline in aggregate investment.

    abstract: The financial economics literature has recently emphasized the health of the financial intermediary sector in driving asset prices and quantities, focusing mostly on measures of intermediariesâ€™ financial leverage and collateral constraints. We identify an alternative channel for financial intermediaries to affect risk and the real sector. We argue that the health of financial intermediaries, as measured by their labor leverage, which proxies for frictions in adjusting labor obligations, is at least as important as financial leverage empirically. Our measure of intermediary labor market risk forecasts the market excess return positively, and debt growth and aggregate investment negatively. In the cross-section, intermediaries with higher labor leverage give out fewer loans; firms connected to such banks invest less. We build a model in which intermediaries use labor for screening and monitoring, and where wages are sticky, to explain these findings.

    abstract: We develop an optimal contracting model in which limited enforcement of financial contracts generates dispersion in marginal products of capital across firms. We show that the optimal contract can be implemented using state-contingent transfers and a simple collateral constraint that limits the capital input of firms by a fraction of the financial wealth of the firm owner. Compared to models with exogenous collateral constraint and incomplete markets (for example Moll (2014)), we find that the degree of measured misallocation is increasing in the persistence of the idiosyncratic productivity shocks. Under the optimal contract, the possibility to transfer wealth from high productivity states to low productivity states allows firm owners to trade off efficient allocation of consumption against the efficient allocation of capital. We show that for reasonable values of risk aversion, insurance needs more than offset production efficiency concerns.
